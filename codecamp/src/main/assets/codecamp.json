      "Description": "Title: Java Developers: how to go from 5 to 9 Summary: A journey through the best and hidden features that came over to Java in the last decade   Java is surely not the first programming language that comes to mind when we talk about innovation and fancy new shining features, especially if you compare it to the likes of modern functional languages as Haskell, Scala, F#, or even C#.   Despite this, in the last 10+ years java language designers and java libraries developers have been very busy trying to push the most relevant and most needed tools to evolve it in the right direction, while keeping intact the core ‘spirit’: that stability, quality and consistency that everyone in the IT world knows and appreciate.   However, as developers in the cold real world out there, unluckily we have to deliver projects rather than play with language features.   This is why, more often than not, most of these new features go severely under-utilized, sometimes even completely ignored by developers, newbies and ‘veterans’ alike.   Of course, this is surely due also to that inherent lag in adopting newer version of the JVM in the enterprise that we all know about. Nevertheless if we are honest, that is not the full picture: we also have to blame ourselves, and our often static mindset to stick to what we know already and have been using in the past, rather than looking for a newer, better way to do things.   I will try to motivate you to refresh your java skills, by having a short journey over the last 10 years in Java development, going through each new version of Java SE (6, 7, 8), to see some of the best and/or most hidden features that came along with each new java release.   Meanwhile, we will also get a glimpse of what will come and what the the future holds for us with Java 9."

Now the rapid rise of powerful mobile devices is making voice interfaces even more useful and pervasive. Speech is ideally suited to mobile computing because a single spoken command can accomplish tasks that would normally require a multitude of swipes and presses. In this presentation we will try to see how we can make a mobile hybrid application driven by voice commands, using technologies like Apache Cordova mobile development framework, HTML5, Javascript and Google Voice Recognition API."

And yet too many applications, once deployed, remain unmonitored and thus, their developers tend to behave passive when it comes to supporting their customers. Ever heard a developer say ‘I don’t know why it doesn’t work for you. It works perfectly fine on my PC.’? During this session I’ll walk you through the best practices of both implementing and using Azure Application Insights so that you will be two steps ahead of your customer and eventually get to be pro-active when it comes to supporting applications deployed in the wild."
